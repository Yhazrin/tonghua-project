# Changelog

All notable changes to the Tonghua Public Welfare x Sustainable Fashion project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased] — Cycle 35

### Fixed

- **Backend (P0)**: 8 paginated endpoints — `count_stmt` now propagates all `.where()` filters. Previously `select(func.count(Model.id))` ignored filters applied to the main query, returning total count of ALL rows regardless of filter parameters. Fixed in: `orders.py`, `artworks.py`, `campaigns.py`, `donations.py`, `products.py`, `supply_chain.py`, `admin.py` (audit-logs + child-participants).
- **Backend (P1)**: `orders.py` — eliminated N+1 query pattern. Order items now batch-loaded with single `in_(order_ids)` query instead of per-order fetch loop.
- **Backend (P1)**: `payment_service.py` — changed synchronous `httpx.post()` to `async with httpx.AsyncClient().post()`. Blocking call was stalling the FastAPI async event loop.
- **Backend (P1)**: `payments.py` — WeChat and Alipay webhook handlers now use `db.flush()` instead of `db.commit()`. The `get_db` dependency already commits on session exit; manual commit was premature and could cause transaction conflicts.
- **Frontend (P1)**: `tokens.css` — added missing `--space-xs`, `--space-sm`, `--space-md` CSS custom property aliases. These were referenced across ~8 CSS module files but never defined.
- **Frontend (P2)**: `HeroFloatingCards.tsx` — replaced 5 instances of default Tailwind `text-gray-400`/`text-gray-500` with editorial token `text-sepia-light`.
- **TypeScript (P1)**: Renamed duplicate `SupplyChainRecord` display type to `SupplyChainTimelineRecord` in `types/index.ts` to disambiguate from API response type in `services/supply-chain.ts`. Updated imports in `TraceabilityTimeline.tsx`, `ProductDetail.tsx`, and `types/index.ts`.

### Verified

- TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors.

## [Released] — Cycle 34

### Fixed

- **Security (P0)**: `payments.py` — Alipay callback `alipay_notify` now fails closed when `ALIPAY_PUBLIC_KEY` is not configured (returns "failure" instead of skipping signature verification).
- **Security (P0)**: Removed frontend HMAC-SHA256 request signing from `api.ts` — `VITE_API_SECRET_KEY` was exposed in client bundle. Auth is now JWT-only (Bearer token + httpOnly refresh cookie).
- **Security (P0)**: Disabled backend signature verification middleware in `main.py` — cascading fix after removing frontend signing. `verify_request_signature()` kept in `deps.py` for future server-to-server use.
- **Security (P0)**: Enabled `TrustedHostMiddleware` in production mode (disabled in development). Extracts allowed hosts from `CORS_ORIGINS` config.
- **Security (P1)**: Rate limiter fail-open path now logs warning for monitoring (`logger.warning` in catch-all `except Exception`).
- **Security (P1)**: Added `/api/v1/contact` to `public_endpoints` list in `deps.py` for IP-based rate limiting.
- **Accessibility (P0)**: `global.css` — Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` overrides for `fade-in`, `fade-up`, `fade-down` keyframes and `.animate-*` classes (WCAG 2.3.3).
- **Accessibility (P0)**: `global.css` — `.form-input:focus` now includes `box-shadow` visible focus ring alongside `outline: none` (WCAG 2.4.7).
- **Accessibility (P0)**: `Layout.tsx` — Added skip-to-main-content link (`<a href="#main-content">`) with `sr-only` / `focus:not-sr-only` pattern (WCAG 2.4.1).
- **Brand (P0)**: `ArtworkDetail.tsx` — Added `SectionGrainOverlay`, corner accents to main content area (was bare PaperTextureBackground with no editorial treatment).
- **UI/UX**: `EditorialCallout.tsx` — Removed dynamic Tailwind class construction (`from-${variant}-transparent` gradient). Replaced `border-[var(--color-info)]` etc. with proper Tailwind tokens (`border-info`).
- **UI/UX**: `EditorialAdvertisement.tsx` — Fixed invalid CSS `border: 1px dashed border-warm-gray` → `border border-dashed border-warm-gray` (Tailwind classes, not CSS property).

### Verified

- TypeScript compilation: `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero errors.

## [Released] — Cycle 33

### Fixed

- **Security (P0)**: Removed `TESTING=1` bypasses from `main.py` — signature verification and rate limiting middlewares no longer skip checks in test mode.
- **Security (P0)**: `auth.py` — mock fallback login now uses `hmac.compare_digest` for password comparison (timing attack prevention). DB failure raises HTTP 503 (fail-closed). Refresh token endpoint looks up user role from DB instead of relying on token.
- **Security (P0)**: `payments.py` — payment amount validated against actual order/donation amounts (prevents amount tampering). Alipay notify fail-closed when key missing. Webhook `APP_SECRET_KEY` null check added.
- **Security (P0)**: Artwork file upload validation — MIME type whitelist (JPEG/PNG/WebP), 10MB size limit, magic byte content verification.
- **Security (P1)**: `payments.py` webhook endpoint — `APP_SECRET_KEY` empty check (fail-closed, returns 500).
- **Accessibility (P0)**: `MobileNav.tsx` — focus trap added (Tab/Shift+Tab cycles within dialog, WCAG 2.4.7 + 2.1.1).
- **Accessibility (P0)**: `global.css` — `.form-input:focus` visible focus ring via `box-shadow` restored (WCAG 2.4.7).
- **Accessibility (P0)**: 5 pages missing `<h1>` — added `sr-only` h1 to Profile, Campaigns, Shop, Stories, Traceability (WCAG heading hierarchy).
- **Accessibility (P1)**: Checkbox touch targets — Login and DonationPanel checkboxes enlarged from 16px to 44px (`w-11 h-11 p-2.5`, WCAG 2.5.8).
- **Frontend**: `supply-chain.ts` — corrected `getProductJourney` endpoint + removed methods without backend support.
- **Frontend**: `ArtworkDetail.tsx` — `useMutation` for vote (replaced orphaned `handleVote` with proper mutation), `queryError` reference fix.
- **TypeScript**: `Traceability/index.tsx` — removed unused `useQuery`, `buildRecordsFromApi`, `STAGE_MAP`. Fixed `number` vs `string` type comparison. `EnhancedSupplyChainRecord` as standalone interface (not extending backend type).
- **TypeScript**: `Login/index.tsx`, `Register/index.tsx` — removed unused `MagazineDivider` import.
- **Backend**: `orders.py` — `import random` moved to top-level (was inside except block).
- **Backend**: Write operations fail-closed — mock write fallbacks replaced with HTTP 503 in 5 router files.

### Fixed (continued from earlier cycles)

- **NotFound page**: Upgraded from bare 404 to full editorial treatment — PaperTextureBackground, GrainOverlay, entrance animation with reduced-motion guard, corner accents, decorative divider.
- **Donate page**: Fixed `DonationStoryCard` reduced-motion bug — `initial` prop was unconditional, now guarded with `prefersReducedMotion ? false : { opacity: 0, y: 30 }`.
- **Traceability page**: Fixed `AnimatedCounter` — added `useReducedMotion()` guard to skip `requestAnimationFrame` animation when user prefers reduced motion.
- **Contact page**: Replaced inline `FAQItem`/`ChevronIcon` components with reusable `FAQAccordion` editorial component.
- **NotFound page**: Removed invalid `opacity` prop from `GrainOverlay` (component accepts no props).
- **ArtworkDetail.tsx**: Fixed infinite re-render loop caused by data fetching in render body. Moved to proper `useEffect` pattern with cleanup.
- **ProductDetail.tsx**: Fixed React Rules of Hooks violation (`useState` inside `.map()`). Extracted `ThumbnailButton` as a separate component. Added `useParams` + API data fetching with mock fallback (was hardcoded `MOCK_PRODUCT`).
- **CampaignDetail.tsx**: Added `useParams` + `useEffect` API data fetching with `snake_case` to `camelCase` field mapping. Previously ignored route params entirely.
- **Backend - artworks.py**: Added authentication (`Depends(get_current_user)`) to `PUT /artworks/{artwork_id}` and `DELETE /artworks/{artwork_id}` endpoints. Previously these mutation endpoints had no auth guard.
- **Backend - artworks.py**: Added admin role check to `PUT /artworks/{artwork_id}/status`.
- **Backend - contact.py**: Added admin role check to `GET /contact/messages`.
- **Backend - products.py**: Added authentication with role check (`Depends(require_role("admin","editor"))`) to `POST /products` and `PUT /products/{product_id}` endpoints.

### Added

- **Sage green accent system**: Introduced low-saturation sage green (#3F4F45) as a complementary cool-tone accent across the site. Semantic color language: rust = urgency/action, sage = trust/transparency/sustainability. Applied to:
  - **Traceability page**: Migrated all 17 `eco-green` references to `sage` tokens (CarbonBar, status indicators, search results, highlighted records, carbon reduction counter).
  - **ProductCard**: Sustainability score tier (≥80) now uses `text-sage`/`bg-sage` instead of `eco-green`.
  - **Home page**: Brand pillar borders (`border-sage/40`), featured/artworks "View All" links (`text-sage`), shop CTA secondary button (`border-sage/40 hover:border-sage`).
  - **Donate page**: Transparency section corner accents, bullet dots, trust badge dots all use sage. Financial report card hover/corner accents use sage. Final CTA decorative lines use `bg-sage/50`. "Learn More" button uses `border-sage/40`.
  - **About page**: Value card top borders use `border-sage/20`. Mission section vertical accent line uses sage gradient.
- **Legal pages editorial upgrade**: Privacy, Terms, and ChildrenSafety pages upgraded from ⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — added `GrainOverlay`, `MagazineDivider` between sections, decorative corner accents, vertical accent line, `whileInView` scroll-reveal animations. Fixed `useMediaQuery` → `useReducedMotion` inconsistency.
- **Routes**: Registered `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/children-safety` routes in App.tsx.
- **Footer**: Updated legal links to match registered route paths (`/children-safety` instead of `/children`).
- **Agent docs**: Created `docs/agent-memory/codebase-index.md` and `improvement-tracker.md` for persistent codebase tracking.
- **Login page**: Upgraded from ⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — added `PaperTextureBackground` wrapping, `MagazineDivider` decorative separator, decorative vertical accent line, animated "Vol. IX" header with decorative divider. Removed redundant GrainOverlay opacity wrapper.
- **Register page**: Same editorial upgrade as Login — `PaperTextureBackground`, `MagazineDivider`, decorative accents, animated header with divider. Consistent editorial treatment across auth pages.
- **Tailwind config**: Added 17 missing color tokens from `tokens.css` — ink-light, sepia-dark, sepia-light, rust-light, rust-dark, pale-gold-light, muted-gray, cream, editorial-red, editorial-navy, editorial-olive, editorial-burgundy, success, error, warning, info.
- **Backend - artworks.py**: `GET /artworks/featured` — returns featured artworks (limit 8).
- **Backend - campaigns.py**: `GET /campaigns/featured` — returns active campaigns.
- **Backend - donations.py**: `GET /donations/tiers` — returns 4 static donation tiers.
- **Backend - donations.py**: `GET /donations/mine` — returns current user's donation records (auth required).
- **Backend - products.py**: `GET /products/featured` — returns active products with stock (limit 8).
- **Backend - orders.py**: `GET /orders/mine` — returns current user's orders (auth required).
- **Backend - orders.py**: `POST /orders/{id}/cancel` — cancels pending orders (auth required, ownership validated).
- **Profile page**: Enhanced with order history and donation history tabs. Fetches from `ordersApi.getMyOrders()` and `donationsApi.getMyDonations()`. Tab switcher with editorial styling.
- **Profile page**: Upgraded from ⭐⭐⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ — integrated `EditorialCard` for order/donation items (2-column grid), added `GrainOverlay` to both sections, added `MagazineDivider` between sections, upgraded not-logged-in state with `PaperTextureBackground` + animated header, enhanced avatar with grain texture. All 19 editorial components now in use.
- **Backend - contact.py**: New contact form submission endpoint (`POST /contact`, `GET /contact/messages`). Registered in `main.py`.

### Removed

- **Contact page**: Removed unused `FAQItem`, `ChevronIcon` inline components, `GRAIN_STYLE` constant, and `openFaqIndex` state (dead code from merge).
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed 8 dead barrel files (`HomePage.tsx`, `AboutPage.tsx`, etc.) that only re-exported from subdirectories.

### Fixed (2026-03-21)

- **TypeScript type safety**: Removed `any` type annotations from `.then()` callbacks in Profile (`Order[]`, `Donation[]`), CampaignDetail (`Campaign`), and ProductDetail (`Product`). Eliminated unnecessary `const raw = data?.data ?? data` pattern — service layer already returns properly typed `response.data`.
- **Snake_case fallback removal**: CampaignDetail — removed 7 `raw.snake_case ??` fallbacks (`cover_image`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `artwork_count`, `participant_count`, `goal_amount`, `current_amount`). ProductDetail — removed 4 snake_case fallbacks (`image_urls`, `stock`, `sustainability_score`, `supply_chain`). Service layer returns camelCase typed data.
- **React list keys**: Replaced `key={index}` with semantic unique keys in KineticMarquee (`marquee-${item}`, `stat-${stat.value}`), FAQAccordion (`item.question`), and ArtworkDetail (`tag`).
- **EditorialHero**: Fixed `boolean | null` → `boolean | undefined` type mismatch on `TextScramble.reducedMotion` prop (`prefersReducedMotion ?? undefined`).
- **Contact page**: Replaced raw `<select>` element with `VintageSelect` editorial component for consistent form styling.
- **OrigamiFold**: Added `useReducedMotion()` hook to `OrigamiCorner` component — was running unconditional rotation animation, violating accessibility.
- **EditorialHero**: Fixed `TextScramble.reducedMotion` prop coercion — `prefersReducedMotion ?? undefined` passes `undefined` when `useReducedMotion()` returns `null`, which defaults to `false` (animations run). Changed to `prefersReducedMotion ? true : undefined`.
- **Stories**: Fixed article `initial` prop — was always `{{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}` regardless of reduced-motion, causing elements to start invisible with no reveal animation. Now fully guarded.
- **Stories/Campaigns/Donate**: Converted `width`-based animations to `scaleX` transforms across 4 locations (Stories ReadingProgressBar, Campaigns funding progress bar, Donate 2 decorative lines) for GPU compositing and hardware acceleration compliance.
- **Traceability/CampaignDetail/ProductCard**: Extended `width`→`scaleX` conversions to 3 more locations — Traceability CarbonBar progress, CampaignDetail funding progress bar, ProductCard sustainability score bar. Added `overflow-hidden` to ProductCard parent container.
- **Register/Login/Profile/NotFound**: Converted decorative divider line animations from `width` to `scaleX` with `origin-center` across 4 page components for consistent GPU compositing.
- **ProductCard**: Added missing `cursor-pointer` to "Notify Me" button.
- **Stories**: Added missing `cursor-pointer` to empty-state "Browse All" button.
- **SepiaImageFrame**: Replaced `as any` type assertion with `Exclude<typeof accentPosition, 'diagonal'>` for proper TypeScript type narrowing.
- **Login**: Fixed "Remember me" label — was missing `<input type="checkbox">` element and `htmlFor` attribute. Added proper checkbox with `accent-rust` styling.
- **Stories**: Added `cursor-pointer` to category filter buttons.

### Added (2026-03-21)

- **SectionGrainOverlay component**: Reusable section-scoped grain overlay component extracted from Donate page inline SVG data URLs. Supports configurable `frequency`, `octaves`, and `opacity` props. Replaces 2 inline grain SVG instances in Donate page.
- **Aria attributes**: Added `role="progressbar"` with `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax` to Campaigns funding progress bars and Stories ReadingProgressBar. Added `role="tablist"` to Campaigns and Stories category filter containers.

### Fixed (2026-03-22 — Cycle 9)

- **Backend P0 — auth security**: Login endpoint no longer logs user email/password on failed auth (was `logger.error(f"Login failed: {e}, user: {user.email}, password: {form_data.password}")`). Registration no longer logs new user email. Removed duplicate email existence check in register endpoint.
- **Backend P1 — banned user flow**: Both `/auth/login` and `/auth/refresh` now check `user.status == "banned"` and return 403 before issuing tokens. Previously banned users could still authenticate.
- **Frontend P0 — skip-to-content**: Added skip-to-content link in `Layout.tsx` — `sr-only` by default, visible on focus, links to `#main-content` anchor. Meets WCAG 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks.
- **Frontend P0 — ARIA tab pattern**: Profile page Orders/Donations tab switcher upgraded to proper ARIA tab pattern: `role="tablist"`, `role="tab"` with `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `tabIndex` management, and keyboard arrow navigation (ArrowRight/ArrowLeft with focus transfer).
- **Frontend P0 — EditorialAdvertisement CSS**: Fixed invalid `border: 1px dashed border-warm-gray` → `border border-dashed border-warm-gray` (was producing invalid CSS).
- **Frontend P0 — EditorialCallout dynamic Tailwind**: Replaced dynamic gradient class `bg-gradient-to-b from-${variant}-transparent` (purged at build time) with static inline `style` lookup object using CSS custom properties.
- **Frontend P0 — EditorialHeroV2 reduced-motion**: Guarded CTA overlay `initial={{ scaleX: 0 }}` and `whileHover={{ scaleX: 1 }}` with `prefersReducedMotion` — was animating unconditionally.
- **Frontend P0 — HeroFloatingCards 3D tilt**: Guarded `rotateX`/`rotateY` transforms, `preserve-3d`, and `translateZ(20px)` with `prefersReducedMotion`. Mouse move/leave handlers now early-return when reduced motion is preferred.
- **TypeScript — unused imports**: Removed unused `MagazineDivider` import from Login and Register pages (TS6133).
- **TypeScript — Traceability API calls**: Fixed `getRecords({ page_size: 50 })` → `getRecords()` (takes optional string, not object). Fixed `.items` access on array response. Replaced nonexistent `.trace()` method with `.getProductJourney()` and mapped service type fields (`timestamp`→`date`, `artisan.name`→`partnerName`).
